# Introduction:
In our daily life temperature plays a vital role. The Room temperature is important for our human body. If the room temperature is too high human body can't tolerate and leads to several damages in our body and if too low it will make our body freeze and it will also affects functioning of our organs. Not only human body will affect due to changes in room temperature. It also affects the things in our house. So we should maintain the temperature constantly.

# Features:
1.Detects the body temperature and immediately displays value of temperature on tha display.

2.Available in low cost and in smaller sizes.

3.Simple circuit design and easy to understand.

# 4W'S and 1H:
## What?
* It is an display based project which detects the body temperature and gives an awareness over the temperature of our body.
## WHY?
* Its a good habit to keep our body temperature normal and also it is very needed for some of the items to be in normal temperatures because they are manufactured for that particular range only so to aware about temperature it is imporatant.
## WHERE?
* We can use it in Medical prone areas ,Houses and also food storing halls.
## WHO?
*  It is an automated detector no need of any manual involvement to reset to normal value so every one who needs can use it.
## HOW?
* A sensor which is the main part of this project and it is the one which detects and displays the value.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## Strength:
- Its strength is compact in size
- accuracy in displaying the correct temperature.
- cost efficient
## Weakness:
- Due to the usage of tiny electronic components need to be very care in handling.
## Opportunity:
- We should create an opportunity to make our product used by everyone by providing an awareness over the adverse effects of over temperatures and importance of surveiling the temperature.
- Due to covid now it is needed everywhere in the world.
## Threat:
- Now there are many new developing companies to competition.
